**A collection of C++ programs demonstrating fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains a series of C++ implementations for various data structures and algorithms commonly encountered in computer science.  The code is intended as a learning resource and practical demonstration of core DSA concepts.  The target audience includes students, programmers, and anyone interested in improving their understanding of DSA principles.  The projects cover topics like linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees.

## ✨ Features

- **Singly Linked Lists:**  Includes creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal operations.
- **Doubly Linked Lists:**  Similar functionalities as singly linked lists, but with bidirectional traversal.
- **Stacks:** Implementation using arrays and linked lists, with push, pop, and peek operations.
- **Queues:** Implementation using arrays and linked lists, with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
- **Circular Queues:** An efficient queue implementation that utilizes circular buffer.
- **Deques:**  Implementation of double-ended queues.
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs):**  Implementation with insertion, deletion, search, and traversal (inorder, preorder, postorder).
- **Balanced BSTs:**  An example of a self-balancing BST (implementation details not specified in available files).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C++

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler (like g++) installed on your system.  A suitable IDE (like Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, or CLion) is recommended.

### Compilation and Execution

The provided code consists of `.cpp` and `.h` files which need to be compiled using a C++ compiler.  Each program likely has its own `main` function.  You will need to compile each `.cpp` file individually, linking necessary header files (`.h`) as needed.  For example, to compile `singly.cpp`, you might use a command similar to:

```bash
g++ singly.cpp -o singly
```

Then, execute the compiled program:

```bash
./singly
```


Repeat this process for each individual C++ file containing a `main` function. Note that some files, like `.o` (object files), and layout files are likely intermediate or related to the build process and should not be directly compiled or run.
